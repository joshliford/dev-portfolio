        projectTitle: "Amplify",
        shortDescription: "Gamified guitar learning dashboard designed to bring structure and motivation to learning the guitar.",
        fullDescription: "Amplify was built to solve a problem I often faced: staying consistent. After playing both electric and acoustic guitar for 10+ years—often on and off as life got busier—the motivation behind Amplify was to create a tool that brings structure, clarity, and fun back into learning and practicing the guitar.",
        note: "This project is currently frontend only. I will be integrating backend functionality using Java, Spring, and MySQL in Spring 2026.",
